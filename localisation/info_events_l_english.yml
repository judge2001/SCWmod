 info.1.d:0 "Republic of Turkey, founded by the great leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk has always had a troubled democratic journey after his death. Many decades full of military coups, terrorism, uprisings, failed coalitions and a bad economy has resulted in the rise of Turkey's most powerful conservative goverment: AKP. They show a promising beginning but they have been stayed at the top for many years and this gives them courage to meddle with current political balance. Yet opposition culture is still very alive in Turkey and once again Turks stand at the crossroads..."

This solved the immediate tensions, but it was only in 1992 when the Kurdistan Regional Government was established, that Kurdistan really became satisfied. Since then there has been relative peace in Kurdistan, but with the rise of radical Sunni jihadism in Iraq, can we preserve our autonomy?"
